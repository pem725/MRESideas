## Steps to clone git repo

1. gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
2. Sign into [GitHub](https://github.com).  Hopefully you have 2FA.  Please.
3. [Create and/or copy your PAT from GitHub.](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
4. Paste your PAT at the prompt that looks like this in your console:

**? Enter password or token: <PASTE YOUR PAT HERE>**

5. Hit enter after you paste.

Now, you are ready to clone the repo with permissions.  Please request to be added to the repo so you can clone, edit, and push the GitHub repo.  The project is one with many hands.  Lend one.

Finally...

6. Follow [this lovely guide](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) to clone the repo in RStudio.
